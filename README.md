Program for generating a chessboard

Users can create a chessboard with custom dimensions:
  a) Set the width and height of each rectangle (square).
  b) Set the length of the chessboard.
  c) Set the number of rows (the program doubles it automatically).

Users can exit the program by holding Enter when prompted.
